# IA N-Queens Problem
This code solve the most commum problem in Artificial Intelligence the N-Queen 
problem.

## N-Queen problem
The problem consist in to place N-queens on a chess NxN board, and them can't attack
each other.

## Hill Climbing Algorithm
Hill climbing attempts to maximize (or minimize) a target function f (x) 
where x is a vector of continuous and/or discrete values. At each iteration, 
hill climbing will adjust a single element in x and determine whether the change 
improves the value of f(x).

## Simulated Annealing
Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global
 optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate 
 global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem. It is 
 often used when the search space is discrete (e.g., the traveling salesman 
 problem).
